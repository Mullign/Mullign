👋 Hey, I’m John Russell!
I’m a Project Manager turned Software Engineer, currently pursuing my Master of Computer Science at Clemson University. I have a strong passion for iOS development, constantly building and experimenting with new apps using Swift and SwiftUI.

🚀 What I’m Into:
📱 iOS Development – Crafting sleek and efficient apps with Swift, UIKit, and SwiftUI.
🖥️ Tech Enthusiast – Love building, diagnosing, and optimizing computer systems.
🚗 Cars & Boats – Whether it's classic cars or boats, I enjoy the mechanics and thrill of both.
🎮 Video Games – Big fan of gaming, from strategy to open-world adventures.
🏗️ Project Management – Years of experience managing large-scale projects, now applying that mindset to software development.
🔥 Current Focus
I’m sharpening my skills in iOS app development, exploring AI integration in mobile apps, and working on personal projects to refine my coding abilities.
